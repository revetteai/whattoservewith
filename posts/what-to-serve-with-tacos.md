Tacos is a hearty dish that pairs well with a variety of sides. Here are five of the best options to serve with Tacos:

## **Guacamole**
Creamy and savory, guacamole is the perfect accompaniment to the crispy and spicy flavors of Tacos. The richness of avocado and tanginess of lime juice help balance out the heat and add a delicious texture to each bite.

## **Mexican Rice**
With its bold flavors of cumin, chili powder, and tomato, Mexican rice is a natural pairing for Tacos. The fluffy rice also helps to soak up any excess sauce or juices from the Tacos, making it a practical and tasty option.

## **Black Bean Salad**
The earthy and hearty flavors of black beans make them a great addition to Tacos. Not only do they add a protein boost to the meal, but the tangy dressing and crisp vegetables in a black bean salad provide a refreshing contrast to the spiciness of Tacos.

## **Mango Salsa**
For a sweet and tangy twist, serve Tacos with a side of mango salsa. The juicy and sweet mango chunks, paired with the tanginess of lime juice and the heat of jalapeno peppers, make for a delicious and refreshing combination.

## **Corn on the Cob**
Grilled corn on the cob is a classic side dish that goes perfectly with Tacos. The smoky and slightly charred flavor of the corn complements the bold and spicy flavors of Tacos, making it a great way to round out the meal.
