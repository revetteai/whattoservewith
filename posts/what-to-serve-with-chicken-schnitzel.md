But what really takes this meal to the next level is the perfect accompaniment. Lucky for you, we've done the legwork and curated a list of scrumptious sides that will turn your schnitzel night into a feast!

## **Crispy Roasted Potatoes**
There's nothing quite like the harmony of crispy Chicken Schnitzel with the golden-brown perfection of crispy roasted potatoes. The potatoes' crunchy exterior and fluffy interior make them an irresistible counterpart. Seasoned with rosemary and garlic, these tantalizing spuds balance the savory goodness of the schnitzel, adding another layer of flavor that will have everyone reaching for seconds.

## **Tangy Coleslaw**
A refreshing, tangy coleslaw is the perfect accompaniment to Chicken Schnitzel. The crispiness of fresh cabbage paired with a zesty dressing, possibly with hints of apple cider vinegar, offers a delightful contrast to the rich, savory schnitzel. This side dish not only adds a fresh burst of flavor but its vibrant colors can also make your plate much more visually appealing.

## **Savory Mushroom Gravy**
For those who love to drizzle or dip, a savory mushroom gravy can transform your Chicken Schnitzel into a mouthwatering delight. Made with an array of earthy mushrooms and rich, creamy sauce, this accompaniment enhances the schnitzel's flavors while adding an extra dimension of savory richness. It's comfort food at its finest, providing that cozy, luxurious feel we all crave.

## **Creamy Mashed Potatoes**
There's a good reason mashed potatoes are a classic side! Their smooth, creamy texture and buttery flavor make them a wonderful pairing for Chicken Schnitzel. These potatoes provide a comforting counterbalance to the schnitzel's crispiness, creating a heartwarming combination that is sure to satisfy. Add a sprinkle of chives for an extra pop of color and flavor!

## **Fresh Garden Salad**
A fresh garden salad brings a burst of color and a refreshing crunch to your Chicken Schnitzel meal. Packed with crispy lettuce, cucumbers, juicy tomatoes, and perhaps a sprinkle of feta cheese, this vibrant side dish is both nutritious and delicious. Adding a light vinaigrette will introduce a tangy, refreshing note that cuts through the richness of the schnitzel, making every bite simply delightful.

### **Bonus: German Pilsner**
When it comes to beverages, a chilled German Pilsner is a fantastic match for Chicken Schnitzel. This light and crisp beer complements the schnitzel's crunchy texture while its mild bitterness balances the savory and oily richness. The Pilsner's effervescence cleanses the palate, ensuring each bite is as satisfying as the first!
