Chicken Curry is a hearty dish that pairs well with a variety of sides. Here are five of the best options to serve with Chicken Curry:

## **Naan Bread**
Naan bread is a perfect accompaniment to Chicken Curry thanks to its crispy exterior and soft, chewy interior. The warm, slightly tangy flavor of the bread perfectly complements the savory flavors of the curry.

## **Basmati Rice**
Basmati rice is a classic pairing for any curry dish, including Chicken Curry. The delicate, nutty flavor of the rice helps to balance out the bold flavors of the curry.

## **Cucumber Raita**
Cucumber raita, a yogurt-based sauce with cucumbers and spices, is a refreshing and tangy side dish that pairs well with the spiciness of Chicken Curry. The coolness of the raita helps to balance out the heat of the curry.

## **Samosas**
Samosas, a popular Indian appetizer, are a great option to serve with Chicken Curry. These crispy, savory pastries filled with spiced potatoes and peas add a textural contrast to the creamy curry.

## **Mango Chutney**
Mango chutney, a sweet and savory condiment made with mangoes, spices, and vinegar, is the perfect accompaniment to Chicken Curry. The tangy and fruity flavors of the chutney provide a nice contrast to the rich flavors of the curry.
