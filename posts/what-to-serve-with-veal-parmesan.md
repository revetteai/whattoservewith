When it comes to preparing a truly memorable meal, veal parmesan is an absolute showstopper. This succulent Italian classic with its crispy breadcrumb coating, savory marinara sauce, and melted cheese brings so much flavor to the table. But here's the thing: the perfect side dish can elevate your dining experience to another level! With these delectable side dishes, each bite of your veal parmesan becomes more harmonious and delightful. Let's dive into some tantalizing pairings that will make your tastebuds sing!

## **Garlic Bread**

What's better than a slice of perfectly toasted garlic bread to accompany your veal parmesan? The crispy, golden crust of the bread contrasts beautifully with the tender veal, while the rich, buttery garlic spread delivers a savory hit of flavor. This classic pairing highlights the Italian roots of the dish and offers a satisfying crunch that you’ll savor with every bite.

## **Caprese Salad**

If you're looking to keep things fresh and vibrant, a caprese salad is the way to go. The tangy, juicy tomatoes, creamy mozzarella, and fragrant basil in this salad provide a cool and refreshing contrast to the warm, cheesy veal parmesan. Drizzling balsamic glaze over the salad adds a sweet and tangy finish that beautifully complements the savory flavors of the main dish.

## **Pasta Aglio e Olio**

For pasta lovers, a simple pasta aglio e olio is a match made in culinary heaven with veal parmesan. The delicate balance of garlic-infused olive oil and a sprinkle of fresh parsley melds seamlessly with the robust flavors of the veal. This dish allows the veal parmesan to shine, while the pasta offers subtle, yet mouthwatering notes that turn your meal into a delightful Italian feast.

## **Sauteed Spinach**

Brighten up your plate with a side of sautéed spinach. The earthy, slightly bitter taste of spinach is a refreshing counterpart to the rich and hearty veal parmesan. When sautéed with garlic and a dash of lemon juice, the spinach transforms into a light and flavorful side that cleanses the palate and brings a leafy green element to your meal.

## **Roasted Vegetables**

For a hearty and colorful addition, roasted vegetables can’t be beat. Crisp, caramelized edges and a medley of sweet and savory flavors make roasted veggies a versatile and satisfying side. The natural sweetness of carrots, bell peppers, and zucchini highlights and balances the bold flavors of the veal parmesan, creating a pleasant melody of tastes on your plate.

## **Bonus: Red Wine Pairing**

To complete your meal, consider pairing your veal parmesan with a lovely glass of red wine, like a Chianti or a Barbera. These wines boast a medium body and a rich, fruity flavor profile that stands up beautifully against the savory, cheesy notes of the veal parmesan. The acidity of these wines helps cut through the richness, creating a perfect synergy with this hearty Italian dish.

Whether you're hosting a cozy dinner or simply enjoying a night at home, these side dishes will transform your veal parmesan into an extraordinary feast. From the crisp freshness of a caprese salad to the comforting warmth of garlic bread, each pairing adds its own unique flair to the meal.
