## **Scalloped Potatoes**
Creamy and comforting, scalloped potatoes are a classic choice when it comes to pairing with baked ham. The rich, velvety texture of the potatoes layered with cheese and butter creates a **decadent** side that balances the **savory** notes of the ham. Their satisfying creaminess and slight garlic undertone provide a **flavorful contrast** to the sweetness of the ham glaze.

## **Roasted Vegetables**
Bring a **vibrant**, **healthy** splash to your ham dinner with a medley of roasted vegetables. The **earthy** tones of carrots, parsnips, and Brussels sprouts are beautifully elevated by roasting, which adds a **caramelized crispiness** that enhances their natural flavors. These roasted wonders not only add color and freshness to your plate but also complement the succulent ham with their **nutty, roasted essence**.

## **Cranberry Sauce**
Bright, tart, and slightly sweet, cranberry sauce acts as a **zesty** companion to baked ham.

## **Green Bean Casserole**
Give your meal a touch of nostalgia with a **hearty** green bean casserole. The **crunchy, savory** topping of fried onions, combined with tender, crisp green beans enveloped in a creamy sauce, creates a dish that pairs perfectly with baked ham. Its **robust flavor** profile and **crisp texture** are the ideal match for ham's juicy softness, making each bite incredibly satisfying.

## **Apple Salad**
For a light and **refreshing** side, consider serving an apple salad.
