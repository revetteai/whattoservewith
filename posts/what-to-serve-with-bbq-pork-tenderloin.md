We've laid out some delectable sides that will complement that tangy barbecue flavor and elevate your mealtime experience to culinary excellence.

## **Crispy Coleslaw**
When you're dealing with rich and savory pork tenderloin, a side that offers a contrast in texture and flavor is a must. Enter crispy coleslaw. With its crunchy texture and tangy dressing, coleslaw brings a refreshing snap that cuts through the richness of the pork. Plus, its creamy finish creates a harmonic balance that leaves you craving more.

## **Grilled Corn on the Cob**
Few things scream 'summer barbecue' quite like grilled corn on the cob. The smoky, charred kernels add a hint of sweetness that pairs delightfully with BBQ pork. Brush on a touch of butter and sprinkle with herbs for an extra layer of flavor. The tenderness of the corn melds beautifully with the meat, making each bite a celebration of taste.

## **Baked Beans**
Rich and savory, baked beans are a classic BBQ side that never disappoints. Their sweet and tangy sauce, often enhanced with hints of smokiness, pairs wonderfully with the tenderloin’s robust barbecue sauce. The soft texture of the beans complements the tender meat, while the flavors intertwine to create a dish that's hearty and satisfying.

## **Garlic Mashed Potatoes**
For a comforting addition to your BBQ lineup, garlic mashed potatoes are a surefire win. The creamy texture of the potatoes, combined with the aromatic notes of garlic, provides a savory backdrop for the bold flavors of the pork. A spoonful of these velvety potatoes alongside your meat creates a perfect mouthful that is both rich and soul-soothing.

## **Tangy Cucumber Salad**
To bring a little lightness to your plate, a tangy cucumber salad is just what you need. Crisp cucumbers paired with thinly sliced onions and a zesty vinaigrette create a refreshing contrast to your hearty main course. This salad adds a burst of coolness and a crisp, clean bite that refreshes the palate and balances the meal.

### **Bonus: Ice-Cold Lemonade**
Nothing complements a smoky BBQ pork tenderloin quite like an ice-cold lemonade. Its tart and sweet flavor washes down the richness of the meat while refreshing your taste buds. The citrus notes cut through any heaviness, making it the perfect refreshment on a warm day.
