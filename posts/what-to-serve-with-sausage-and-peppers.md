## **Garlic Bread**

Garlic bread is the crispy, buttery partner your sausage and peppers have been waiting for. The rich, garlicky flavor and airy texture of a warm slice are perfect for soaking up any saucy goodness left on your plate.

## **Creamy Polenta**

Creamy polenta is a dream come true when it comes to pairing with sausage and peppers. This smooth, buttery concoction provides a luscious contrast to the bold, zesty flavors of the main dish. The mild, comforting taste allows the spices in the sausage to shine, while the comforting creaminess wraps everything together beautifully. It's like a warm culinary hug on your plate!

## **Roasted Vegetables**

For a burst of color and flavor on your table, try serving sausage and peppers with roasted vegetables. Roasting brings out the natural sweetness and earthy undertones of vegetables like carrots, zucchini, and bell peppers. The result? A perfect medley of roasted, caramelized flavors that complement the savory, sizzling sausages and peppers. Plus, it's a nutritious option that adds a touch of balance to your meal.

## **Herbed Couscous**

Herbed couscous is light, fluffy, and brimming with fresh flavors thanks to a sprinkle of fragrant herbs like parsley and mint.

Sometimes, you need a fresh and tangy touch to cut through the richness of sausage and peppers, and a Caesar salad does just that. With crisp romaine lettuce, savory Parmesan cheese, and a signature tangy Caesar dressing, this salad brings a refreshing crunch to the table. The contrast between the fresh, zesty flavors and the savory sausage makes this pairing a winner every time.
