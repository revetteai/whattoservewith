Fire up those grills, because BBQ season is here and what better way to celebrate than with a delicious BBQ salmon dinner? This savory dish is not only perfect for summer soirées but also a hit at any dinner table year-round. But let's face it—just the salmon alone won't cut it! You're going to need some stellar sidekicks to make this meal unforgettable. That's where we come in with this inspired list of side dishes that complement BBQ salmon's rich, smoky flavor.

## **Grilled Asparagus**
Grilled asparagus is the perfect match for BBQ salmon because they both love the sizzle of the grill! The crispy, tender spears of asparagus bring out the succulent, smokey flavors of the salmon beautifully. Plus, those charred edges add an appetizing crunch that’s hard to resist.

## **Lemon Herb Quinoa**
Lemon herb quinoa is a superb side for BBQ salmon due to its fresh and tangy flavors that easily absorb the savory essence of the fish. This whole grain is light and fluffy, bringing a delightful contrast to the rich texture of the salmon. A sprinkle of fresh herbs adds a vibrant, earthy dimension that ties the whole meal together perfectly.

## **Roasted Sweet Potatoes**
Roasted sweet potatoes offer a sweet and savory balance to BBQ salmon that is simply irresistible. Their natural sugars caramelize beautifully when roasted, creating a crispy exterior and velvety interior. This scrumptious side also provides a pleasing contrast to the smoky, somewhat spicy profile of the salmon, making each bite a harmonious adventure.

## **Caprese Salad**
Caprese salad is a colorful, refreshing addition to your BBQ salmon repertoire. The juicy tomatoes and creamy mozzarella drizzled with balsamic reduction bring a tangy sweetness that perfectly complements the rich, smoky fish. Not to mention, the fresh basil adds an aromatic twist, enhancing every bite.

## **Garlic Parmesan Roasted Brussels Sprouts**
If you’re looking for something savory and a bit more robust, garlic parmesan roasted Brussels sprouts are a fantastic option. The crispy, caramelized edges are infused with garlicky goodness and a nutty parmesan finish that balances the smokiness of the salmon. It’s a flavor-packed combo that elevates the meal to gourmet status.

### **Bonus: Citrus White Wine Spritzer**
As you indulge in the exquisite flavors of BBQ salmon and its perfect pairings, consider enhancing the experience with a crisp citrus white wine spritzer. This refreshing beverage cuts through the smoky richness of the salmon and side dishes, providing a zesty, bubbly twist that keeps each mouthful refreshing. It's the ideal drink to keep your palate invigorated!

As you can see, there are countless ways to turn a simple BBQ salmon into a meal worth remembering. From the crispiness of grilled asparagus to the sweet lushness of roasted sweet potatoes, each side offers a unique flavor profile that can elevate your salmon to new heights.
