The creamy and tangy flavors of guacamole provide a refreshing balance to the rich and spicy fajitas. The smooth texture of guacamole also helps to cool down your taste buds after taking a bite of a hot and sizzling fajita.

## **Mexican Rice**
The classic combination of fajitas and Mexican rice is a match made in heaven. The savory and slightly spicy flavors of the fajitas are enhanced by the fragrant and fluffy rice. Plus, the rice helps to soak up any excess sauce from the fajitas.

For a light and refreshing side dish, try pairing fajitas with a corn salad. The crisp and sweet kernels of corn provide a nice contrast to the bold flavors of fajitas. You can also add some tangy lime juice and cilantro to the salad for an extra burst of flavor.

## **Grilled Vegetables**
For a healthier option, grilled vegetables are a great choice to serve with fajitas. The charred and smoky flavors of the veggies complement the sizzling and spicy fajitas. Plus, the different textures and colors of the vegetables add a nice variety to your meal.
